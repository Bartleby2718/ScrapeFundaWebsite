# ScrapeFundaWebsite
[Funda](https://www.funda.kr/v2/) is one of the few marketplace lenders in South Korea. To diversify my portfolio, I invest some amount of money in their bonds. However, their website having such terrible UI and UX, it takes so much time for me to scan through the bonds and decide in which bonds to invest. Hence, I've decided to create a Python script that scrapes the necessary data from their website and creates an Excel file, so that I can easily manipulate the data.  

## Discontinuation
- 2020.01.12.: This project has been discontinued because I no longer believe the bonds traded through the website are reliable. For the borrowers, refinancing has been the main source of repayment, but now the supply of bonds is overwhelmingly greater than the demand.
